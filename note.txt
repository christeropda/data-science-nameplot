During the webscraping from imdb, when finding the different characters each row is on a newline. 
However, there are some episode numbers that comes in between them. These had to be removed from 
the list we used to keep the names from. 

While searching for datasets that could be used for the different countries, it was an challenge to
find a national stastic database that shows all names, instead of just top 50 or 100. Initially we 
wanted to include Denmark as well to our plots, but since we could not find any tables that shows
all names instead of just top 50 for them, we did not want to include that data, as names for TV-shows
may not be included there.
