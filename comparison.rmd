# About the project

The project is to look at the names of newborns in Norway and Sweden, and compare the names they get against big TV shows. We first want to compare it against a big international TV show, and see if the names of the newborns are affected by this. Then we find a big TV show for both Norway and Sweden, and check if there is any differences. We will be comparing Norwegian girls against Swedish girls, and the same with the boys.

# Initial Questions
When we started the project initially, we were curious if the names that are used for Game of Thrones, were later seen as names for newborns in Norway and Sweden, and if any names were present before the TV show started if any names got more popular. However, when we got the results in from Game of Thrones, we realized that were few of the names were actually used. We then figured out we could look at different TV shows that were made in Norway and Sweden, and do the same analysis for those. We then got hit by the issue that for Skam in particular, some of the names were so popular that it became very hard to read the graphs. We then limited the number of characters to those that had been in the most episodes. Since the popularity of the different names are different from show to show, this limitation is also different between them. 


# Data
### Webscraping
The information about actor names, and how many episodes they were involved in, were webscraped of imdb.com. The scraping were done using python, and the libraries requests and bs4. 

### Statistics
For the names we used, we looked up in table on ssb.no for Norway, and then downloaded the data in a csv file. The Swedish data we found on scb.se, we found a excel file and converted this to a csv. These files are read as normal files and their content is appended to a list.
